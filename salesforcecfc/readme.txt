project: SalesForceCFC

-overview-
This CFC allows you to connect and work with SalesForce.com,
one of the largest CRMs out there. It does so by generating SOAP requests,
and manipulating their responses.
This will make it easy to work with their SObjects,
and allow you to do more than just query.

-requirements-
ColdFusion 7 or Higher
Salesforce.com Account (Developer Accounts are freely available)

-usage-
The constructor (init method) is required.

if not using auto login, 
you will have to call the login() method manually to activate a session

SalesForce requires you to add your IP to the their Control Panel under SETUP \ SECURITY CONTROLS \ NETWORK ACCESS.

-note-
be careful with concurrency issues if using multiple accounts.
it is not meant to be persistent if using more than 1 account.
